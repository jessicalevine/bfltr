# bfltr
A program in Brainfuck that inputs a letter from stdin (takes the first byte of stdin) and outputs a Brainfuck program that outputs that letter to stdout. Made for the first night of hackNY Fellows 2013.

## Instructions
Send your letter in via stdin to your Brainfuck interpreter. Assuming your interpreter is Bff:
```
echo f | ./Bff ltr.bf
```

## Testing
Seriously? This is a Brainfuck program. I fucking dare you to write tests. I fucking dare you.
